A dataset from Santiago de Chile, where there are a few details about different house transactions, such as the latitude/longitude coordinates, the transport accessibility context of the area, the characteristics of the household that bought the house.
The project has three components:
- Prediction challenge. Predicting the type of household that will buy the house, given the area characteristics by the implementation of different classification models.
- Exploratory component. How introducing new variables that give meaningful information help the models to reach a better performance in the prediction task.
